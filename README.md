Node.js Driver for Foscam

There's already a nodejs foscam driver [here](https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-foscam), but due to firmware difference, it's not compatible with mine. So I decide to write one my own.

My foscam device information:

Product Name  | Bought At    | Firmware Version | Hardware Version | 
------------- | -------------| -----------------| -----------------|
EH8135 V3     | 2015-4-28    | 2.51.1.30        | 1.9.1.11         |
